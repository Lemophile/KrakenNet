# ü¶ë KrakenNet - Web Killer v1.6

KrakenNet is a high-performance HTTP DoS tool. It simulates random user traffic using rotating User-Agents, random HTTP methods, and dynamic paths. Optional proxy support is included to help bypass basic DDoS protections.

Currently it's the only real DoS tool on github, i mean it is the only one who can really take down websites.

Tested on Ubuntu and Termux.. Should work on all the plateforms.
